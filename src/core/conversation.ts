/**
 * Conversation History Manager
 *
 * CONTEXT ENGINEERING CONCEPT: Multi-Turn Conversation
 *
 * LLMs are stateless — they have zero memory between API calls.
 * To create the ILLUSION of an ongoing conversation, we must
 * resend the ENTIRE conversation history with every request.
 *
 * This means:
 *   - Every previous user message is included
 *   - Every previous assistant response is included
 *   - The context grows by ~2 messages per turn
 *   - Eventually, the context window will fill up
 *
 * This module manages that growing history. In Part 10, we will
 * add compression to handle the case when history exceeds the budget.
 * For now, we simply maintain and return the full history.
 *
 * CONCEPT: Memory Is Just Resending
 *
 * There is no magic to LLM "memory." When the model appears to
 * remember what you said 5 turns ago, it's because we literally
 * included that message in the current request. If we omit it,
 * the model has no idea it ever happened.

   *
   * CONTEXT ENGINEERING INSIGHT: This array grows linearly
   * with the conversation length. At ~500-2000 tokens per
   * turn, a 30-turn conversation uses 15,000-60,000 tokens
   * of history. This is why compression (Ch 10) is essential.
